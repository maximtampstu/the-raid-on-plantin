            <p><span>But</span> we are told by the Spanish king that there can be no <span class="highlight highlight--black">Calvinist</span> books because they are against Catholic doctrine and
              threaten the unity of the faith. For this the king says we have to make a <span class="highlight highlight--black">list</span>, after the list is finished I print it
              and walk to the store to hang it there. Some of the books we are not allowed to sell are my own books so I throw them on
              the fire pile.</p>

                  <p>Now a few weeks on I have been using this a lot my employees love it and I see more smiles on their faces now. Now I am
                  thinking that I can use this for all words and have this printed to publish.</p>
                  <p>Here was born the first <span class="highlight highlight--black">dictionary</span> that you know to this day</p>
                  <p>Now I can communicate with my workmen but not with the courriers <span class="translation">(mailmen)</span>, these people often can't read well if at all
                  so I start making a <span class="highlight highlight--black">logo</span> so the courrier <span class="translation">(mailman)</span> knows if he is at the right address or not.</p>
