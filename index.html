            <p>I wake up, my father Jean Plantin is already up and in the kitchen, he tells me that I got a letter from my brother.</p>
            <p>By brother he means Pierre Porret We lived together for a while and he really became my very best friend, in other words
            my brother.</p>
            <p>I open the letter with a knife, the letter is about the plague epidemic around Tours. I remember that my mother is
            staying there. I immediately read on tense, word after word until I read “Ta mère est, par malheur, trépassée de la
            peste” (your mother has unfortunately died of the plague). I immediately start crying and look at my father, he already
            knew, he walks up to me and hugs me.</p>

            <p>My father often has to travel around for work. We have been in Paris for a while, he steps up to me and gives me a sum

            <p>He does tell me that he will come back to take care of me again. But will he? I immediately start looking for a job. I
            offer myself in different places with little success. Many maîtres (employers) tell me that I must have done a study
            first or they won't hire me. So I don't stick to my bones and enroll in a study.</p>
            <p>I am a few months far into my studies and receive an unknown letter from the courrier (mailman).</p>

              Now a few days later I am quiting my studies and moving to Normandie where everything is much cheaper. I now have to
              find a new study, teacher is high on my list but after searching for a while I found nothing finacially feasible.</p>
              <p>I continue thinking, I have quite an interest in books which is why I wanted to become a teacher. It comes to mind,</p>

              <p>I look for a school and find one where I would study under Robert Macé. This study takes

          <div>
            <p>I have been working for several years now and have gotten the idea to start a printing business myself. I heard
            somewhere last week that Antwerp is in a boom period that is apparently somewhere in Belgium I am trying to get more
            info</p>
            <img src="" alt="Dotted line">
            <p>and find a corner house in Antwerp where I can start. Me and my wife take the big step and move to Antwerp. After a
            short time we get the studio next to the corner house donated so we can properly start the printing business.</p>

          <div>
            <p>I do now bump into a problem the monnaie (money) is up. So I go to my wife to brainstorm together. Soon we bump into the
              idea of a store. The idea is to sell books or even separate sheets here. We start making the store.</p>
            <p>But we are told by the Spanish king that there can be no Calvinist books because they are against Catholic doctrine and
              threaten the unity of the faith. For this the king says we have to make a list, after the list is finished I print it
              and walk to the store to hang it there. Some of the books we are not allowed to sell are my own books so I throw them on
              the fire pile.</p>

              <p>Now there is another problem, the language. everyone here speaks néerlandais (dutch) but I don't. I have trouble
              communicating with my employees I have been taking Dutch lessons for several months but with little success. My Dutch
              teacher has now given me the task of writing down all the words that I often need so that I can be sure to know the
              translation of them.</p>

                  thinking that I can use this for all words and have this printed to publish.</p>
                  <p>Here was born the first dictionary that you know to this day</p>
                  <p>Now I can communicate with my workmen but not with the courriers (mailmen), these people often can't read well if at all
                  so I start making a logo so the courrier (mailman) knows if he is at the right address or not.</p>

              <p>This is very important because many spelling mistakes come up. Often a capital letter is forgotten or letters are

              <p>When they are 12, I remove them as spelling correctors and give them a task that better suits their qualities. Now my
              second daughter Martina Plantin is turning 12 I have been watching her qualities lately she has developed a real passion
              for linen. So I no longer let her be a spell corrector but let her make linen. We are now selling these linens in the
              store. She comes running up to me and shouts</p>
              <p>“Dad, dad I have an idea, what if we hire seamstress to make clothes out of the linen to sell too?”</p>
              <p>I laugh and say “That is an excellent idea”.</p>

            <p>A man comes to visit me in the print shop he introduces himself and tells me that he has been stealing bodies of dead
            criminals to map the human body he tells me that he wants to have a book printed about this. That seems interesting so I
            bring him to my office to discuss further business.</p>
